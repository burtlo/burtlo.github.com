I recently had the opportunity to instruct several new developers in the nuances
of the Ruby language.

There is a strong emphasis now for developers to test drive their development.
Several of the exercises utilized tests as a safety net. Other exercises did
have them write code to make tests pass.

Despite what I would call a solid upbringing the students do not immediately
reach for their test framework when they start working on new exercises. It 
just does not feel comfortable trying to write tests when you barely have an
understanding of the complexity of the problem and the scope of the language.

To those of us polyglots, now working in our third or fourth language we find
it a far easier venture. I think we should think twice before we require, 
enforce, or guilt new developers writing software to bring with them tests in
tow.

Test Driven Development requires a much greater level of mastery and 
understanding than we often give credit.

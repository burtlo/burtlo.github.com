iOS developers, as most other developers, give software away. A few months ago
when I started down the path of iOS development I was saddened by the lack of
community software in comparison to my experiences with Ruby. Namely I was
saddened by the fact that there was no easy way to discover software libraries
and tools. I was wrong. They have a community and there are definitely resources
to assist with finding iOS software and components. However, it is still hard to
integrate software into an existing application. By hard, I mean it's a fairly
manual process of downloading/cloning a repository and then manually importing
files into the Xcode project file. Oh, the Xcode project file we will have to
talk more.

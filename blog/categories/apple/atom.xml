    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I first started watching the Apple Developer videos, that are available
through the iOS Dev Center, I was always amused by the participants at the talks
clapping throughout various demonstrations. The presented feature would likely
be saving the developers a new heap of time or give them a new tool for their
belt. It's become a bit of a joke over the last few weeks. A fellow developer
will be dragging-and-dropping some code object into a storyboard or xib file and
I will start clapping. Always amusing when it's dropping a textfield.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Developers make terrible testers ... and designers and ... likely anything other
than a developer. In reality I think that most people that attempt to handle
more than one concern at a given moment are generally bad at any of the
supplementary tasks.</p>

<p>I am not trying to say that I am an exception to this rule, but I will say that
when I attempt to test something or put a little design on top of it while I am
still in the midst of delivering development aspects I will often times do
terrible work. Just awful.</p>

<p>The process I use to get this to work is to deliver on my development tasks.
Take a break. Return to the work, rested and ready to test it or do some design
for it. If it sounds familiar - it is! It is exactly the strategy that most
every instructor has presented to you about writing and editing your own essays.</p>

<p>Of course, there is no hope for you if finishing the work the night before. :)</p>
